  Course Feedback & Reflections</h4>
  <p>These two components are in the same environment, both under the control of the eps32 feather development version. The way they receive data is through sound sensors and pressure sensors. They are both in motion and driven by the user. There is a difference between the sensor and the signal receiver and this difference is determined by the value of the code. In the course of the experiment, the input values of the sensors are evaluated based on the motion of the outputs, and the pressure and sound size interval changes are constantly tested, therefore modifying the size of the sensor output values in the programming. Transmission can be continuous or indirect, and it is possible to transmit and receive information at the same time. In the real world,the user can see the LEDs blinking and the engine fan rotating.</p>
  <p>By connecting the diode, transistor, relay, motor fan, and force sensitive resistor, so that they form a current path to pass the output data to the IO feed, based on the companion signal receiver to sense the data. In this process, I learned how to use the transistor TIP 120 and diode many times. </p>
