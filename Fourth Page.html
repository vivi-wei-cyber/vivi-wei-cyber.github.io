      <p>Build a similar system in the digital realm: the basic workflow of the World Wide Web is what we have in the digital realm with Rube Goldberg. user (cell phone/computer/ipad) enters the URL (http:// or https://) -> Web uses (DNS) to get the IP address ->Web sends HTTP request to server for information (file/image/style/script) ->Server responds with content of Web resource (HTTP) ->Web receives HTML and renders interface based on DOM model -> In the process of rendering, render CSS and jvavscript (coding into visual interface) -> Get a new round of loop from hyperlinks.</p>
      <p>Types of data that can be transferred: Text (HTML, SMTP) / File (PDF/JPEG/TTF/MP3/MP4/MOV) Application (SQL/FTP/SSH) Streaming (User Datagram Protocol) JSON /XMC/Instant Messaging Data (SLACK/IG) HTML (JAVASCRIPT/CSS), all of which are transferred in the form of a byte stream.</p>
      <p>IFTTT/ZAPIER/MICROSOFT POWER AUTOMATE/WEBHOOKS/API/CHATOPS/SERVERCES These servers can be connected to each other in series, a transfer of information to reach the user's purpose, to facilitate the user's life, and make work more efficient.</p>
    <p>Trigger is a put in instruction to the program, the system through a series of operations eventually output a final result.Trigger: the user performs the operation request -> operation: the trigger causes an automated workflow -> intermediate steps: the workflow performs a series of intermediate steps (validation/processing/storage) ->Final result: the user's request is completed and a success alert notification is received.</p>
